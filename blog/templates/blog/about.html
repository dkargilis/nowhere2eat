    <h1 align="center">About</h1> <br>
    <h6 align="left">Nowhere2Eat was created as a hobby project to address a common situation: when a group of friends all wanted to go out to eat but we couldn't decide on a place. It was always a hassle to suggest places in the chat only to have it shot down. I realized there should be a tool to incorporate everyone's interests. <br> <br> This website was coded with the Django Web Framework. Server side configuration is in Python, and client-side operations run through Javascript, HTML, and CSS. This website was deployed using Heroku with a custom domain. I also used the Boostrap CSS framework and animations from Animate.css: https://animate.style/</h6>
